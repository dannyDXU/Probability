You may read about them further <a href=\"https://numpy.org/doc/1.16/reference/routines.random.html\">here</a>, but all the information you need will be presented here, and then we will do some experiments involving a standard deck of 52 playing cards, reproducing experimentally one of the problems you solved analytically above. \n",

After that goal is achieved, however, it is better to use the library functions, not your own.  The standard library functions are the ones you will use in the future, and in any case they are implemented using state-of-the art random number generators and are the most efficient possible implementations.  There is no reason to use your own (presumably less well-implemented) once the goal of understanding is finished. \n",
